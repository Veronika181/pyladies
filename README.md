Asteroids Game 

Description:
As part of the PyLadies course, I created a game inspired by the classic Asteroids. In this game, the player controls a spaceship using arrow keys and shoots lasers at asteroids that randomly move across the screen. The game consists of a simple game loop where the spaceship responds to player inputs—rotating and moving with the arrow keys, and shooting lasers with the spacebar.

Preview:
The game includes:

Input Controls: The player controls the spaceship with arrow keys (rotating and moving) and shoots lasers with the spacebar.
Game Mechanics: The spaceship shoots at asteroids, which move randomly across the screen.
Objective: The goal is to destroy all the asteroids without colliding with any of them.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Web Browser: Any modern web browser.
Code Editor: A code editor like Visual Studio Code.
Usage:
The game inspired by Asteroids includes several key features:

Input Controls: The player uses arrow keys to control the spaceship’s movement and the spacebar to shoot lasers.
Game Mechanics: The spaceship responds to player inputs, asteroids move across the screen, and lasers destroy them.
Objective: The player aims to shoot down all the asteroids on the screen while avoiding collisions.

Future Developments:
To enhance the game, I plan to add several new features, including:

Score Tracking: Implementing a scoring system that tracks how many asteroids the player has destroyed.
Start Button: Adding a start button to initiate the game.
Lives: Introducing a lives system where the player starts with three lives. When hit by an asteroid, the spaceship will respawn at the center of the screen with zero velocity, and the player can continue playing until all lives are lost.
Game Over and Win Screens: Displaying a large "GAME OVER" or "WINNER" message at the end of the game, depending on the outcome.
