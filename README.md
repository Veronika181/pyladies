Asteroids Game 

Description:
As part of the PyLadies course, I created a game inspired by the classic Asteroids. In this game, the player controls a spaceship using arrow keys and shoots lasers at asteroids that randomly move across the screen. The game consists of a simple game loop where the spaceship responds to player inputs—rotating and moving with the arrow keys, and shooting lasers with the spacebar.

The game includes:

Input Controls: The player controls the spaceship with arrow keys (rotating and moving) and shoots lasers with the spacebar.
